# Instructions: 
Your final project consists of creating a task management app. Tasks have a title, a desciption, a signature (created_on, created_by), a deadline, and a status (pending, ackowledged, rejected, completed, failed). Task also have comments.

You create tasks and assign them to yourself and/or other users. Every user must have a manager (another user), except the CEO, and every user can edit their own tasks as well the tasks created by people he/she manages.

# Every user should be able to:

1. select and change own manager
2. create a task
3. see all the tasks
4. edit a task (any field) but only if created by self or a managed person (important!)\
5. add a comment to any task
6. filter tasks by:\
  -date created\
  -deadline\
  -status\
  -created by self\
  -assigned to self\
  -created by a specific user\
  -assigned to a specific user\
  -created by any managed user\
  -assigned to any managed user\
You must use py4web. Vue is optional.

Different members of a team should be assigned a clear responsibility, perhaps a specific page. One person must be the group leader with the responsibility of submitted the final project. Teams will be assigned by the professor. Your team picks the group leader.

# Grading
